# Paketo UBI10 Builders

## Paketo UBI 10 Builder

## `docker.io/paketobuildpacks/ubi-10-builder`

This builder uses the [UBI 10 Base images](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi-10-base-images) (a Red Hat UBI 10 base images) with buildpacks for Node.js.

For example, with the `pack` CLI:

```
pack build my-app \
    --path ./path/to/app \
    --builder docker.io/paketobuildpacks/ubi-10-builder
```

To see which versions of build and run images, buildpacks, and the lifecycle that are contained within a given builder version, see the corresponding assets of each builder from the [Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi-10-builder/releases) on this repository. This information is also available in the `builder.toml` of each builder.

For more information about this builder and how to use it, visit the [Paketo builder documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/builders/).

To learn about the base images included in this builder, visit the [Buildpacks base images](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-app-developers/concepts/base-images/) and the [Paketo ubi10 Base images repo](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi-10-base-images).

## Paketo UBI 10 Buildpackless Builder

## `docker.io/paketobuildpacks/ubi-10-builder-buildpackless`

This builder uses the [UBI 10 Base images](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi-10-base-images) (a Red Hat UBI 10 base images) and contains **no buildpacks nor order groups**.
To use this builder, you must specify buildpacks and extensions at build time using whatever mechanisms your CNB platform of choice offers.

For example, with the `pack` CLI, use `--buildpack` or/and `--extension` as follows:

```
pack build nodejs-app \
    --path ./path/to/nodejs/app \
    --buildpack docker.io/paketobuildpacks/nodejs \
    --extension docker.io/paketobuildpacks/ubi-nodejs-extension \
    --builder docker.io/paketobuildpacks/ubi-10-builder-buildpackless
```

To see which versions of build and run images and the lifecycle are contained within a given builder version, see the [Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi-10-builder/releases) on this repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.
